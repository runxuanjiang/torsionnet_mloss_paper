    \noindent Dear [Names of Editors]: \\
    
    We would like to submit our manuscript "Conformer-RL: : A Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Conformer Generation" as well as the source code for the Conformer-RL library for publication in the machine learning open source software section (MLOSS) section of the Journal of Machine Learning Research. The software library Conformer-RL is an open source Python library for the application of deep reinforcement learning in the chemoinformatic task of conformer generation. The library is released under the open-source MIT license. The library is available publicly on both Github: \url{https://github.com/ZimmermanGroup/conformer-rl} and PyPI: \url{https://pypi.org/project/conformer-rl/}. Documentation is also available online at \url{https://conformer-rl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}. The version of the code we would like to have reviewed is version 1.0.0 on PyPI or the master branch on Github.
